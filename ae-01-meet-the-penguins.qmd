For this application exercise, we'll use the pandas and palmerpenguins packages.

```{python}
#| label: load-packages

import pandas as pd
from palmerpenguins import load_penguins
```

First, let's read in the data.

```{python}
penguins = load_penguins()
```

The dataset we will visualize is called `penguins`.
Let's `.info()` at it.

```{python}
2 * 4
```

-   **Your turn:** Replace `#add code here` with the code for "info"ing at the data `penguins` data frame â€“ `penguins.info()`. Render the document and view the output.

```{python}
#| label: info-penguins

# add code here
```

-   **Demo:** First, replace the blank below with the number of rows in the `penguins` data frame based on the output of the chunk below. Then, replace it with "inline code" and render again.

```{python}
#| label: len-penguins

len(penguins)
```

There are 344 penguins in the `penguins` data frame.
